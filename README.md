### "Procrastination is the key to finishing." - ghimaill, 2024
A guy with an ascending dream, and yet he never elevates. I write code in the **go** language, but I do other languages in my spare time. Mainly I do coding as a side-hobby, but the time will come that I'll do actual coding. For now, expect some inactivity when I try to think of what to do. *(You can do a pull request on any of my repos, then I'll try to look into them in the Morning.)*
